Here I presented my implementation of dash

to achieve the desired effect operation under the vfh script you must add desks with the name "vfx" and "dashvisual"
which directly contain the effects of dash and ability rollback, you can also download my models in the repository

To create the most productive and smoothly running dash, I used a raycast for the correct movement if there is an obstacle ahead of the player, I also used OOP in all my modules, which gave a boost to both the readability of the code and its performance, and parallel lua
